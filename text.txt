Summary:
 
 
 
 
 
Abstract:
 
 
 
 

 
Automation of farm activities  can
  
transform  agricultural domain  from 
being manual  and  static  to  intelligent  and dynamic  leading  to higher 
production with lesser human supervision. 
Water management is paramount 
in countries with water scarcity. This also affects agriculture, as a
 
large 
amount of water is dedicated to that use.
 
 

 
Most of the farmers use large portions of farming land and it becomes very 
difficult to reach and track every corner of the large land. Sometimes there is 
a possibility of uneven water sprinkles. This resul
t in the bad quality crops 
which further leads to financial loses. In this using 
IOT Based Irrigation 
System 
is helpful and ease of
 
farming.
 
 

 
 
We present a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art 
regarding intelligent irrigation systems. 
We determine the parameters that 
are monitored in irrigation systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil 
characteristics and weather conditions. We provide an overview of the most 
utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we will discuss the
 
challenges and the best practices for the implementation of sensor
-
based 
irrigation
 
systems.
 
 

 
The setup uses soil moisture sensors which measure the exact moisture level 
in soil. This value enables the system to use appropriate quantity of water 
which avo
ids over/under irrigation. IOT is used to keep the farmers updated 
about the status of
 
sprinklers.

Aims & Objectives:
 
 
 

 
Agriculture is the major backbone of Indian Economy. Most of the available 
fresh water resources are used in Agriculture. The agricultural sector is one 
of the most important economic resources in these countries adding to the 
importance of
 
managing well the available water resources to ensure the 
continuing of this economical sector.
 
 

 
Due to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation 
systems for agriculture and the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that 
can be a
pplied in the development of these systems. In this survey, we are 
going to provide an overview of the state of the research regarding irrigation 
systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation 
systems regarding water quantity an
d quality, soil characteristics, weather 
conditions, and fertilizer
 
usage
.
 
 

 
In the recent years automated and semi
-
 
automated technologies been 
deployed for irrigating the field which has replaced the traditional 
Agricultural mechanism. The cloud and IOT 
technology in recent year 
entered agriculture and by using these two technologies the farmer is 
increasing production and reducing cost. In this paper a system is discussed 
which uses both cloud and IOT technologies for controlling the irrigation 
system. T
he system discussed comprises many elements for performing 
specific
 
task.
 
 

 
For the next generation agriculture fields, data collected from sensors would 

would uncover the new ways t
hat tap the full potential of agriculture yield 
and alleviate all the challenges that hinders the growth of the
 
crop.

Ideation
 
Canvas:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
An ideation canvas is a rough whiteboard where ideas can be stretched 
into any limits or 
dimensions. Ideation session is not aimed at finding 
solutions to the defined problem, but to define
 
the best possible problem 
and stretch out its possible scope. The ideation canvas is separated into 
various 
sections 
such as
 
users, activities, situation
s, props.

Product Development
 
Canvas:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
The product Canvas is a strategic product planning tool that 
allows you to quickly capture, describe, challenge, and pivot your 
product strategy on just a single
 
page.
 
 

 
The Product Canvas has helped
 
us to identify what are the top customer 

solution, and what we really need to learn from our customers.
 
Technologies Used So Far:
 
 
 
 
 

 
The available traditio
nal methods of irrigation are drip irrigation, sprinkler 
system. The current irrigation methodology adopted employ uniform water 
distribution which is not optimal. So accordingly technologies being applied 
towards agricultural monitoring which is required 
by
 
farmers.
 
 

 
Standalone monitoring station, Wireless Sensor based monitoring system 
been developed which is composed of number of wireless sensor nodes and 
a gateway. Agriculture Modernization that has already started by some of the 
tech savvy farmers. For
 
the next generation agriculture fields, data collected 
from sensors would become the fertilizer to grow
 
crops.
 
 

 
In addition to employing technologies in monitoring the agriculture for 
automating the irrigation system, there is need for some intelligence which 
allows machines to apply some intelligence in interpreting agricultural data 
captured and accordingly analyz
e data towards predicting the output rather 
than following traditional rule based algorithm. So towards this, Artificial 
intelligence plays a key role which allows devices to learn without being 
explicitly
 
programmed.
 
 

 
Most of the system just captures the 
data from the field and accordingly 
controls the sprinkler valve for watering the field. In none of these systems, 
there exists intelligence which analyses the real time data based on past 
experience for irrigating the
 
field.

Materials and Methods:
 
 
 
 
 

 
The 
IOT Based Irrigation System 
which is capable of 
automating the 
irrigation process by analyzing the moisture of soil and the climate condition 
(like raining). It provides water supply at the right time, in right quantity and 

 
growth.
 
 

 
By 
using sensors like moisture, rain, etc. water supply for irrigation can be 
managed easily by analyzing the condition of soil and climate. Soil moisture 
sensors smartly measure the soil moisture and based on that data, field is 
getting irrigated automatical
ly with less human interventions. The complete 
data of moisture is accessible to the farmers at distance on the mobile
 
also.
 
 

 
Intelligent IOT based automa
ted irrigation system where the
 
moisture 
sensors deployed in field communicate to micr
ocontroller. The sensed 
moisture 
value is then transmitted using serial communication to 
microcontroller
. 
Micro
 
Controller then
 
sends this field data to another 
microcontroller through the means of GSM module or LoRa module.
 
 

 
The system here co
nsists of following components.
Firstly the 
Microcontroll
er part where Soil Moisture 
deployed in soil is connected to 
Microcontroller which gives the moisture 
ou
tput based on soil condition
. 
The data received by Microcontroller are then
 
manipulated based on Custom 
Algorithm
.
 
 

 
Custom A
lgorithm been employed for 
monitorin
g
 
the soil condition
 
based 
on Moisture level
. The predicted output is then used for sending the control 
signal via the serial communication to Microcontroller for controlling water 
pump for watering the field
 
accordingly.

Methodology:
 
 
 

 
 
Water sprinkler control was achieved by setting a threshold value at which 
irrigation should begin. When the sensors switched on the moisture content 
is low. The threshold values depend on the type of
 
soil used. API for the 
Internet of Things that enables you to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and 
act on data from sensors or Micro
-
 
controllers. Lora Module is also used 
here to enhance the range capacity of the
 
system.
 
 

 
The values obtained  through 
 
sensors  enable  the  system  to  switch the 
sprinkler on and off. A farmer can remotely monitor the irrigation process on 
the farm. 
The soil moisture, rain and the control unit act accordingly to 
sensed data and control the water
 
pump.
 
 
 
Outcomes:
 
 

 
The Intelligent IOT based Irrigation System developed involves Micro
-
 
Controller 
as processing unit. In a
ddition Moisture
 
Sensors deployed in soil 
for sensing the 
soil moisture level. These sensors are conne
cted to 
microcontroller where sensed information sent to the microcontroller for 
action. In addition to these sensors, the actuator for water pump also 
connected to sensors for pumping the
 
water.
 
 

 
The System is not only used in field by the farmers but can
 
be used to solve 
other problems where continuous monitoring of water supply is required like 
in a garden, or a personal small field, or in the watering the stadium when 
necessary etc. It optimally controls the water pump and highly reduced the 
electricity
 
consumption of farm and the production of farm is increased 
because of controlled water supply to
 
crops.

Implementation
 
Story:
 
 
 
 
Conclusion & Future Perspects:
 
 

 
Agricultural monitoring is very much needed to reduce much of human labor 
and at the same time minimize on water usage. Lot of system been 
developed employing Wireless Sensor in monitoring and predicting the soil 
condition for irrigating the field. In addi
tion machine learning techniques 
been employed towards crop yield and crop disease prediction
 
only.
 
 

 
IOT Based Irrigation System presented over here results in complete 
automated irrigation system employing IOT Technologies where devices 
communicate among 
themselves in predicting the soil condition for watering 
the field. This proves that the use of water can be diminished and hence 
water will not be wasted as compared to the present records. It reduces the 
human resources. This irrigation system will be fe
asible and cost effective 
for optimizing water resources for agricultural production. The irrigation 
system can be adjusted to a variety of specific crop needs and requires 
minimum maintenance.
 
 

 
Furthermore, the Internet link allows the supervision through
 
mobile 
telecommunication devices, such as a Smartphone. Besides the monetary 
savings in water use, the importance of the preservation of this natural 
resource justify the use of this kind of irrigation systems. Project concludes 
that automation of irrigat
ion system will become easy and comfortable for 
farmers to operate the irrigation 
at 
remote location i.e. from their native. 
This will save time, avoid problem of continuous vigilance, help in sustain 
the productivity and increasing the
 
yield.
 
 

 
In Future, 
Intelligent IOT based Irrigation system can be extended not just 
for irrigating the field with water but also for deciding on spraying 
appropriate chemicals for proper growth of crop. The same work can be 
extended by looking into water level in tank before
 
irrigating the field. 
Lastly the data security and integrity of agricultural data can be secured 
while transmitting for analysis towards prediction and sending the control 
signal for
 
actuation.
